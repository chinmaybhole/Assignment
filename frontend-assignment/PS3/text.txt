Metadata is used to provide additional information about a web page to search engines and web browsers. It is typically included in the head section of an HTML document and is not displayed on the page itself.

Some common types of metadata include:

Title tag: The title tag is used to define the title of a web page. This is typically displayed in the browser's title bar and is also used as the main heading in search engine results.

Meta description: The meta description provides a brief summary of what a web page is about. This is often displayed in search engine results and can be used to entice users to click through to the page.

Keywords: Keywords are used to indicate the main topics or themes covered on a web page. While keywords are no longer used by Google as a ranking factor, they can still be used by other search engines.

Author: The author metadata provides information about who wrote the content on a web page. This can be useful for establishing credibility and expertise.

Robots: The robots metadata is used to tell search engines whether to index a web page or not. This can be useful for pages that are not meant to be indexed, such as login pages or thank-you pages.

In summary, metadata is used to provide additional information about a web page to search engines and web browsers. This information can help improve the visibility and usability of the page.
